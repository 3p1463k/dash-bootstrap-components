# README

In this directory we recreate some of the examples from the [shiny gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) using Dash Bootstrap Components. Shiny is also based on Bootstrap, so we can construct similar apps very easily. Some of the visual differences are due to `shiny` using Bootstrap 3 whereas `dash-bootstrap-components` uses Bootstrap 4.

Some apps have additional dependencies that aren't installed automatically with `dash-bootstrap-components`. You may need to install a subset of the following packages to get the examples to run:

*   `dash-core-components`
*   `pandas`
*   `scikit-learn`
*   `wordcloud`
